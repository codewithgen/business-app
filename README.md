## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While learning on this project, I learn how to add more than one value for the filter property and got to play around with animations. In terms of designing, I learn how to better plan for each project before starting on a design.


<code>

```` CSS
.text-arch {
    transform: translateX(6.875rem) scale(0.7) translateY(0.3125rem);
  }

   filter: invert(100%) drop-shadow(3px 2px var(--black));
</code>


### Continued development

In the future I would like to focus on incorporating JS into all my project and get more familiar and comfortable with it. I am starting the Odin and will continue to work on projects that are more JavaScript focus. I want to improve my project planning skills by taking the time to understand what is that I am creating before starting a project. That would allow me to have a more consistent feel in all of my project moving forward.
